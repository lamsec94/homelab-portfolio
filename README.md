# Homelab Infrastructure Portfolio

A two-node Proxmox-based homelab engineered to mirror enterprise infrastructure patterns across
virtualization, identity, networking, security, and automation. This repository serves as the
primary landing page for all lab documentation, architecture decisions, and operational runbooks.

## Architecture
Internet
│
[ER7206] ── Transit VLAN 100 ──▶ [OPNsense VM] ── LAB VLAN 10
│ │
GUEST VLAN 20 [Proxmox Cluster]
IOT VLAN 30 su1 (48GB) + su2 (16GB)
MGMT VLAN 1 │
│ [Pi5 - AdGuard + Tailscale]
[GS308EP Managed Switch]


All inter-VLAN routing handled by OPNsense in a router-on-a-stick configuration.
Single NAT boundary. MGMT remains untagged on vtnet0.

## What I Built

Migrated a flat home network into a fully segmented, enterprise-style infrastructure across
5 VLANs with OPNsense handling all routing and firewall policy. Deployed a dual-node Proxmox
cluster running 15 VMs and LXC containers across Windows and Linux workloads. Implemented
dual identity management with Active Directory (Windows Server 2022/2025) and FreeIPA
(AlmaLinux), enterprise PKI with a wildcard certificate across all 14 internal HTTPS services,
a full Splunk SIEM pipeline ingesting from 10+ sources, and an Ansible automation layer
managing 12 hosts across 6 inventory groups. All services are reverse-proxied through Nginx
Proxy Manager with TLS termination via an internal CA.

## Identity & Access

**Windows — Active Directory**
- Domain: `homelab.local` | Primary DC: LAB-DC (WS2022) | Secondary: LAB-DC2 (WS2025)
- OU hierarchy: `Corp-Computers`, `Corp-Users`, `Engineering`, `IT Staff`
- GPOs: screen lock, 7-Zip deployment, WSUS targeting, USB storage blocking
- Enterprise Root CA (`homelab-CA`) via ADCS — wildcard cert covering all 14 internal services
- LDAP service account pattern (`svc-glpi`) for least-privilege third-party integration

**Linux — FreeIPA**
- Host: `ipa01` (AlmaLinux) | Enrolled: `ipa01`, `ubuntuserver`
- HBAC: `allowadmins` active, `allowall` disabled
- Sudo rule requiring password prompt for all admin operations

---

## Security & Monitoring

**Splunk Enterprise SIEM**
- 10+ log sources: OPNsense syslog, Suricata IDS alerts, Windows Event Logs, Linux auth logs
- Universal Forwarders deployed via Ansible to all Linux VMs; Windows via MSI
- Dashboards: Authentication, DNS Intelligence, FreeIPA, Lab Health, Linux Security, Network Traffic, Windows Security

**Suricata IDS** — inline on OPNsense with alert forwarding to Splunk

**Hardening Baseline** (Ansible-enforced on all Linux hosts)
- SSH key-only auth · `ufw` default-deny · `fail2ban` · scheduled patching

**PKI**
- All 14 services served over HTTPS with wildcard cert signed by internal `homelab-CA`
- CA cert distributed to system trust store and Firefox on Fedora admin workstation

## Automation

Ansible Controller on Ubuntu 24.04 managing 12 hosts across 6 inventory groups.

| Inventory Group  | Members                               |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| proxmox_cluster  | proxmox1, proxmox2                    |
| linux_vms        | ubuntu-server, almalinux, kali-purple |
| windows_vms      | windows-dc, windows11, LAB-DC2        |
| lxc_containers   | forgejo, splunk, nextcloud            |
| docker_hosts     | docker-host                           |
| splunk_servers   | splunk                                |

**Key playbooks:**
- `update-all.yml` — fleet patching across apt/dnf/Docker; runtime reduced from 23 min → 2 min after SSH pipelining and module optimization; 12/12 host success rate
- `deploy-glpi-agent.yml` — cross-platform GLPI asset discovery agent deployment across Linux fleet
- `splunkforwarder` role — UF deployment and log source configuration across all Linux targets
